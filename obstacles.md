Here are my obstacles:

PHP
I wish I had more time to practice this before starting on the quiz because I clearly did not have enough grasp on the subject to complete the quiz without being guided by my hand.

CSS
Goddamn flex and buttons ruined my mood.

mySQL
I missed an entire day when we started studying this, which is why I struggled a lot to catch up, and I had to pester Carolina for the most simplest things, which is very frustrating as I do not like to bother people.

Motivation
I am prone to harsh self-critique, which cost me a lot of energy in this project as I struggled along. I am still unhappy with the result but at least it works and my mental health is stabilising.
