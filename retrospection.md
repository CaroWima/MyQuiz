Welcome to my retrospection

The Good
It was a very valuable experience to work with databases the way we did, also did I have the possibility practice my skills again.

The Bad
At one point during archiving I accidentally moved a file which broke my entire construct. After restoring the file to its original place, I found out through Mirko that the fix to my problem was an easy one.

The Ugly
I am stressed. And it clearly affects my ability to remember and my focus. In the end I was able to create a functional quiz, but not without extensive help, and I am not happy with the result. I definitely need more practice, because just knowing the basics won't help me write my own code. Furthermore, I am frustrated with my own performance, which has been steadily declining in the past few weeks. I hope to get better.
